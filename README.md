# What I learned

### Using props for CSS 
- To avoid rewriting code, I learned to use props for CSS, for example: 
```html
<div className={props.anyClassNameHere}> </div>
```
### Scaling SVGs
- During this I have learned to scale SVGs with the transform property, by taking the width and height of the SVG and adapting that. 
- For example, if the SVG was 'width: 450' the css property would be:

```css
.svg-image {
  transform: scale(0.45);
}
```
- You can then use this and adapt it for different screen sizes, for example I added 10 for tablets and small screens and an extra 30 for desktops. 

### Nested routes in react router dom 

- In react router dom, they have nested routes so that you can have multiple navigations on one page. 

- For example in the main App/Routes component you can have:
```js 
<Route path='/mercury' element={<Components.MercuryNav/>}>
  <Route index element={<Pages.MercuryOverview/>}/>
  <Route path='structure' element={<Pages.MercuryStructure/>} />
   <Route path='surface'  element={<Pages.MercurySurface/>} />
</Route>
```
- Then in the component you would Links or NavLinks like:
```js 
<NavLink to='/mercury' end><span>01</span> Overview </NavLink>
<NavLink to='/mercury/structure'><span>02</span> Structure </NavLink>
<NavLink to='/mercury/surface'><span>03</span> Surface </NavLink>
```
- Note: NavLink comes with an isActive/.active class to easily style the links, whilst Link does not.

- [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link) - This is the react router documentation - Read it, documentation is good!
